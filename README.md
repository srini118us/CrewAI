# CrewAI Project

This repository demonstrates two advanced multi-agent AI workflows using [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI), [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), and related tools.

---

## 1. multiagent.py â€” Tech Trend Analyzer

**Description:**
This script sets up a multi-agent system with two roles:
- **Senior Researcher:** Uncovers groundbreaking technologies in a user-specified topic.
- **Writer:** Crafts a compelling, easy-to-understand article about the topic.

**Workflow:**
- The user is prompted to enter a topic (e.g., "AI in healthcare").
- The Researcher agent investigates the latest trends, pros, cons, and market opportunities.
- The Writer agent creates a 4-paragraph markdown article based on the research.

**How to run:**
```bash
python multiagent.py
```

**Sample Output:**
```
=== CrewAI Tech Trend Analyzer ===
[INFO] Crew created successfully.
Enter topic: AI in healthcare
[INFO] Running crew for topic: AI in healthcare

=== Crew Result ===
# Advancements in AI in healthcare
...
```
The output will include a detailed report and a markdown-formatted article saved as `new-blog-post.md`.

## 2. rag.py â€” RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline

**Description:**
This code demonstrates a simple but powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow using CrewAI agents and tools.

- **Router Agent:** Receives a user query and decides which tool is best suited to answer it:
  - If the question is about a research paper, it uses a vectorstore tool (e.g., PDF search with embeddings).
  - If the question is about current news or events, it uses a web search tool.
  - For general questions, it uses a language model (LLM) to generate a response.
- **Retriever Agent:** Uses the selected tool to find or generate the answer, and returns the response to the user.

This approach ensures that the system can:
- Quickly find relevant information from research papers using semantic search (vectorstore).
- Provide up-to-date answers for current events via web search.
- Generate helpful responses for general knowledge questions using an LLM.

# Agent: Router
## Task: Analyse the keywords in the question What is Apple's stock price right now?   
Based on the keywords decide whether it is eligible for a vectorstore search or a web  
search or generation. Return a single word 'vectorstore' if it is eligible for
vectorstore search. Return a single word 'websearch' if it is eligible for web search. 
Return a single word 'generate' if it is eligible for generation. Do not provide any   
other preamble or explanation.

# Agent: Retriever
## Task: Based on the response from the router task extract information for the        
question What is Apple's stock price right now? with the help of the respective tool.  
Use the web_search_tool to retrieve information from the web in case the router task   
output is 'websearch'. Use the rag_tool to retrieve information from the vectorstore in
case the router task output is 'vectorstore'. Otherwise generate the output based on   
your own knowledge in case the router task output is 'generate'.
